# EntityPlus Features #

For an overview of all features in EntityPlus, download the level designer manual here: https://github.com/TheEnginesOfCreation/EntityPlus/releases/tag/1.1.4

## Additional info about the 1.1.10 release ##
  * `[`Added] "loottarget" key to target\_botspawn to allow bots to drop items or holdables when fragged.
  * `[`Fixed] Spawning a bot causes scores to be written to wrong file in multi-bsp levels.
  * `[`Changed] New backpack model by DaEngineer.
  * `[`Changed] Removed target_script from gamecode. The entity type no longer exists.

Most important changes:

**loottarget key for target\_botspawn**

Bots normally don't drop weapons or items when they die in EntityPlus. Many games reward the player for dealing with enemies by dropping loot when the enemy is killed. To facilitate this type of reward, EntityPlus now allows level designers to set a loottarget key on target\_botspawn entities. The value of the key is the targetname (or targetname2) value of any item (weapons, ammo, health, armor, powerups) or holdable (medkit, teleporter, keys). The targeted item or holdable won't spawn into the level (similar to how target\_give works) but is dropped by the bot when it dies.

**multi-bsp level fix**

A long standing bug caused scores to be written to a file with the wrong filename when bots were spawned in a multi-bsp file level (levels which use the target\_mapchange entity). If you make and release a multi-bsp level, it is advised to set your level's minversion (in the .arena file) to at least 1.1.10

## Additional info about the 1.1.4 release ##
  * `[`Fixed] notarget console command does nothing.
  * `[`Fixed] Entities with matching targetname2 don't respond to target\_modify.
  * `[`Fixed] target\_unlink won't unlink target\_relay or target\_delay entities.
  * `[`Fixed] Picking up backpack can push ammo count beyond 999.
  * `[`Added] trigger\_target command.
  * `[`Added] target2 key to target\_modify.
  * `[`Added] target\_modify can be used to change value of "damage" or "dmg" keys.
  * `[`Added] Surfaces with a shader with "surfaceparm flesh" will make flesh footstep noises instead of the default sound.
  * `[`Added] GIVE\_PLAYER spawnflag to target\_give.
  * `[`Added] IGNORE\_PLAYER, PATROL\_WALK and ALWAYS\_WALK spawnflags to target\_botspawn.
  * `[`Added] Green glow to BFG bolts.
  * `[`Added] notep key to prevent entities from spawning in EntityPlus.
  * `[`Changed] g\_debugBotSpawns echoes out health for spawned bot.

Most important changes:

**notep key added to all entities**

EntityPlus now supports the "notep" key for all entities. This key works similar to the notq3a and notta keys, meaning that any entities that have the value of this key set to 1 won't be spawned in EntityPlus games. In theory, this allows level designers to create an ordinary deathmatch level and then tag the correct entities with "notep" or "notq3a" keys so that the same map can be played in deathmatch games using baseq3 or as single player adventure using EntityPlus.


**trigger\_target console command**

The trigger\_target console command can be used to trigger entities with specific targetname or targetname2 values. Usage of the command is:

trigger\_target `[`targetname]

where `[`targetname] is replaced with any targetname/targetname2 value that should be triggered. This can be used to test parts of complex entity setups or trigger entities that would normally require a relatively long time to trigger.

**additional target\_botspawn spawnflags**

The target\_botspawn entity received a number of new spawnflags. These are: IGNORE\_PLAYER, PATROL\_WALK and ALWAYS\_WALK. The IGNORE\_PLAYER spawnflag can be used to force bots to always ignore the player (even when attacked). Patrol walk and always walk can be used to force the bot to walk (only when patrolling or always, respectively). These spawnflags can be used to create more believable non-combat or NPC characters.

Most important changes:

**It is no longer necessary to run EntityPlus maps in g\_gametype 8**

The g\_gametype cvar is completely ignored now.

**New scoring system**

The calculation of high scores has changed, so all previous scores are ignored and the scoring starts from scratch. The mod does save a top 5 of scores now.

  * `[`Changed] Setting cg\_letterBoxSize to 0 completely removes letterbox effect.
  * `[`Changed] New objectives overlay.

Most important changes:

**Specifying a minversion in the .arena file**

Arena files can be expanded with a "minversion" key that can be used to specify which version of EntityPlus is required to run this map. At this point, only a value of "1.0" is supported. Refer to chapter 4.5 ("Creating an .arena file for your map") of the manual for more information.

**Skill score modifier**

The score modifier for the skill level that is being played at now runs from 1.0 to 1.4. This means that the skill level has less of an impact on the final score. This also means that playing at Nightmare difficulty will most likely result in a lower score than people have been achieving so far. Therefor it is advised to remove the EntityPlus/Games/ep\_example.epgame file if upgrading EntityPlus from an older version.

**func\_timer's default random value**

Quake 3 would assume a default random value for func\_timers of 1. In EntityPlus this has changed to 0. So if you have used any func\_timers in a map that do not explicitly specify a random key, it is advised to specify a random value of 1.

**shooter`_` entities damage level**

Shooter`_` entities would deal the full amount of damage. From 1.0 onward, the skill level that is being played at influences the damage for shooter`_` entities in the same way as it does with the amount of damage bots deal.

**Specifying model/headmodel through worldspawn**

The playermodel and playerheadmodel keys can be added to the worldspawn entity to force the player model that the player will be playing with.

  * `[`Changed] Using the skill key on target\_botspawn now actually influences the general AI skill level of that bot.
  * `[`Changed] Picking up a weapon if no weapons are currently held will automatically switch to that weapon.

  * `[`Changed] Countdown is no longer displayed when issueing a map\_restart.
  * `[`Changed] Default health value for target\_botspawn was changed from 125 to 100.
  * `[`Changed] Bot health is higher/lower depending on skill level.
  * `[`Changed] Picking up weapon for which you already have ammo adds normal amount of ammo instead of just 1.
  * `[`Changed] Removed info\_player\_deathmatch from entities.def
  * `[`Changed] Renamed the skill levels.

Most important changes:

**Cutscenes**

Cutscenes can be made using the target\_cutscene and info\_camera entities. Refer to the related sections in the manual for additional info on the subject.

**Subtitles**

Subtitles can be enabled/disabled through the games option menu. Level designers can enable the "SUBTITLE" spawnflag on target\_print entities, so that the text of the entity will be displayed as subtitle. This is useful when supplying subtitles for spoken dialogue.

**info\_backpack entity**

A known problem for level designers was players dying in lava, slime, the void or other similar hazards. The backpack that is spawned upon the player's death would become irretrievable. Info\_backpack entities can be placed in the map so that the backpack teleports to the nearest info\_backpack entity whenever it hits a brush that is textured with the common/nodrop texture.

**target\_variable entity**

The target\_variable entity can be used to create variables and assign values to them. The target\_variable entity can read these variables as well and activate other entities depending on the value of the variable. Any variables that are written to memory will persist across mapchanges (when the mapchange is initialized by a target\_mapchange entity). This allows level designers to open a door in one map while the switch to open it is in another map!

**deathmusic key for worldspawn entity**

From beta 1 onward, whenever the player dies the screen will fade to black and a "You died" message will be displayed. Music can be played while the player is dead. By default, no music is played, but by setting the deathmusic key the level designer can specify the music file that should be played while the player is dead.

**info\_player\_deathmatch entity removed**

The info\_player\_deathmatch entity was removed from the entities.def file. This means that it is no longer available in Radiant. Any maps that are already using such entities will still function correctly but will show up incorrectly in Radiant. It is preferable to replace all info\_player\_deathmatch entities with info\_player\_start entities.

**Changes to spawning bots**

Before the beta 1 release, target\_botspawn entities that have no health key defined would spawn bots with 125 health. From this release onwards, bots are spawned with 100 health by default.
Also, the amount of health bots are spawned with is not directly influenced by the skill level the player is playing at. When playing at the medium difficulty setting, bots will spawn with the specified amount of health. At higher difficulty levels, bots spawn with more health (20% extra for skill 4 or 40% extra for skill 5). At lower skill levels, bots spawn with less health (20% less for skill 2 or 40% less for skill 1).
Finally, using the skill key on target\_botspawn does not only influence the amount of damage a bot deals, it also influence the health it will spawn with and the actual AI level of the bot (though for AI level 5 is the maximum).

**Ammo pickup**

EntityPlus now uses the Team Deathmatch ammo pickup system which means that if a player picks up a weapon after picking up an ammo box, the weapon will add the full complement of ammo to the player's inventory (similar to picking up an ammo box). Before the beta 1 release, players would receive only 1 ammo for the picked up weapon if they already had ammo for the weapon.


## Additional info about the v0.8.1 release ##

Here's the full list of changes:

  * `[`Fixed] Looping target\_speakers do not stop playing their sound when triggered.
  * `[`Fixed] Center print messages (such as target\_print message) are not displayed.

Most important changes:

**target\_speaker changes**

In the original Quake 3 Arena, it was impossible to toggle target\_speaker entities off when they had either the LOOPING\_ON or LOOPING\_OFF spawnflags set. Once a looping target\_speaker was playing its sound, it couldn't stop anymore. In EntityPlus, a target\_speaker can be toggled off again by triggering it with another entity.


## Additional info about the v0.8 release ##

Here's the full list of changes:

  * `[`Added] target\_modify entity.
  * `[`Added] target\_secret entity.
  * `[`Added] func\_rotating can be started/stopped by targeting it with a trigger.
  * `[`Added] START\_OFF spawnflag to func\_rotating.
  * `[`Added] Added target2 key to a number of entities.
  * `[`Added] Added targetname2 key to a number of entities.
  * `[`Added] scoreboardmusic key to worldspawn entity.
  * `[`Added] path\_corner entities can have a wait key of -1 which will halt the train until the train is triggered again.
  * `[`Added] STONE\_DEBRIS spawnflag to target\_debrisemitter and func\_breakable.
  * `[`Added] Explosion sound when score is being added up in scoreboard.
  * `[`Added] Lightning effect to main menu background.
  * `[`Fixed] Accuracy does not persist across map changes.
  * `[`Fixed] Players respawning at a spawnpoint targeting a target\_remove\_powerups that removes all weapons end up holding a Gauntlet.
  * `[`Fixed] Objective texts of more than 60 characters run outside of the objectives overlay.
  * `[`Fixed] Objectives updated notification sound does not play if cg\_draw2d is set to 0.
  * `[`Fixed] Highscores are saved to incorrect file when target\_mapchange was used.
  * `[`Fixed] Added missing spawnflags to info\_player\_start in entities.def.
  * `[`Changed] From this release forward, multiplayer modes are officially no longer supported.
  * `[`Changed] target\_disable is renamed to target\_unlink.
  * `[`Changed] Shortened fade-in at start of level if no message key was set for the map's worldspawn entity.
  * `[`Changed] Accuracy is no longer a seperate item in scoreboard and only applies to carnage score.
  * `[`Removed team related entities and spawnflags from entities.def.
  * `[`Changed] Removed FLAGS spawnflag from target\_remove\_powerups.
  * `[`Changed] Removed multiplayer option from main menu.
  * `[`Changed] Removed some multiplayer related settings to the setup menu.


The most important changes:


**Multiplayer is no longer supported**

Multiplayer game modes are no longer supported. Technically they're still there, in full working order, but a number of the new entityplus entities simply don't work well in multiplayer scenarios. To remove all responsibility of having to support that as well, multiplayer is officially out. It also frees up the possibility of re-using multiplayer related structs in the code which are hardcoded into the engine as well, so in the future, the technical functionality of multiplayer may be gone or degraded as well.


**Saving highscores**

It appears saving high scores got broken somewhere between the 0.6 and 0.7.1 releases but I should have it fixed for good now. The game would always save the high score to a file named "0.epgame" which is obviously incorrect.


**target\_modify**

The new target\_modify entity can be used to change key/value pairs (properties) of entities run-time. This makes it possible, for instance, to have a func\_train target a path\_corner sequence but, after pressing a button that triggers the target\_modify, have the path\_corners target a different sequence of path\_corners so the train will move through a different path. Another example is to change the target of a trigger or button.


**target\_secret**

There's also the target\_secret entity now, which allows you to put secrets into your map. Finding a secret earns the player bonus points which will be displayed on the scoreboard.


**target2 and targetname2**

All entities that can trigger a different entity or be triggered by another entity can use the target2 and targetname2 keys as well. These's are similar to the target and targetname keys. It allows you to set up a trigger that activates two other entities with different targetnames, or have an entity that can be triggered by two triggers with different targetnames. target/targetname2 and target2/targetname combinations are possible, so an entity with target2 "t1" will activate an entity with a matching targetname, just like an entity with targetname2 "t2" will be activated by an entity with a matching target.


**toggling func\_trains and func\_rotatings**

path\_corner entities can now have a wait key of -1, so that the train stops moving when it reaches that path\_corner. The train starts moving again when it's triggered. A func\_rotating can also be triggered to make it stop or resume moving.


**target\_disable** _important for mappers!_

target\_disable has been renamed to target\_unlink, so change the value for the classname key on any target\_disable entities you have in your map.
